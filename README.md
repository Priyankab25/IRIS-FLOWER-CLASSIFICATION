# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower classification using python 
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.
Now, the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. 
Main objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
Develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
